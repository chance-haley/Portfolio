# Portfolio  | Chance Haley

Hello! Thank you for showing interest in my computer science portfolio. 
Currently I have included my full coursework from my class and the book Building Java Programs 5e. You can find that in the folder under the book title.
The chapters were completed in numerical order and you can see my skills develop overtime including the use of JavaDoc, JUnit and other tools that professionals use.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have also included in the portfolio the current state of my work-in-progress self-made videogame. You can find that in the JavaRPG folder.
My videogame currently is played from the Central java file but simply running it as an executable. It runs from the terminal and is a culmination of my Java experience.

Hopefully everything is very well organized and I'm always open to suggestions.
