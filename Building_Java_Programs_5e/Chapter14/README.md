# Chapter 14: Stacks and Queues

I have completed the following programming exercises:

- 14.5 equals
- 14.8 isPalindrome
- 14.15 isSorted
- 14.19 removeMin

This repository demonstrates my ability to work with and manage data sets and structures. I am able to sort, find values and see if specific criteria are met using stacks
and queues. I think I did pretty well on this assignment and only needed to look at the Java API.
