# Chapter 12: Recursion
@Chance Haley

I have completed the following programming exercises from the textbook:
- 12.4  doubleDigits
- 12.9  sumTo
- 12.17 permut
- 12.22 subsets 

This repository demonstrates my ability to work with recursive problems and solutions. Although I struggled alot with doubleDigits and
couldn't solve subsets, I tried very hard and think I could have gotten it with more time. All of the descriptions of the methods are 
included in JAVADOC formatting. Cheers!
