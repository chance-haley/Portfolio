# Chapter 16: Linked List

I have completed the following exercises using the LinkedIntList provided based off the sample code from the textbook.

- Add the methods push and pop to LinkedIntList so that it can behave like a Stack.
- 16.9 stutter
- 16.15 equals (modified to work with JUnit)
- 16.18 doubleList

This assignment demonstrates my ability to manipulate linkedLists. I had alot of fun problem solving the method doubleList because I had to really visualize what
was happening to the pointers to prevent a never ending loop. In the end drawing it out on paper always helps but I also had to troubleshoot by changing my toString 
method to show my that I was stuck in this loop. In the end I even cut down my code by removing an extra ListNode that was not necessary which was keeping reference to the
front of the unchanged list, but I never change the reference to front so this is unnecessary. Overall I feel pretty confident in this material. This assignment also demonstrates
my ability to creating proper JavaDoc comments and a create a proper JUnit test of my methods.
