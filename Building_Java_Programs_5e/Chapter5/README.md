# Chapter 05: Program Logic and Indefinite Loops

I have completed the following exercises from the text book:

- 5.9  printFactors (error on negative)
failed test due to extra message - no error
- 5.11 threeHeads (needs to take a seed as a parameter)
- 5.18 digitSum
- 5.24 isAllVowels (error on null) - textbook requests an empty string return true, not sure what you mean by error on null.
failed test due to unknown reasons, unable to troubleshoot.

edit: Found what you mean by error on null, java automatically throws an error so it's all gravy.
edit2: Found in tester you want us to throw the exception, why if java does?
