# Chapter 13: Searching and Sorting

I have completed the following programming exercises:

- Write an iterative version of BinarySearch that returns true if the given element exists within the given list.

- Write a version of BubbleSort that sorts in descending order as opposed to ascending order.

- Write a version of SelectionSort that finds the max on each iteration of the loop but still gives ascending order.

- Write a version of QuickSort that uses a random index to pivot.

I utilized Junit to test my methods and they all include proper JAVADOC formatting. This assignment demonstrates my profeciency in building Data sorting structures and
the implementation and limitations of each type of sorting.
