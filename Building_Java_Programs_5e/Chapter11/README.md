# Chapter 11: Collections
@Chance Haley

I have completed the following programming exercises from the textbook:
- 11.2 alternate
- 11.5 sortAndRemoveDuplicates
- 11.9 hasOdd
- 11.16 is1to1


These methods demonstrate my ability to work with Lists, Sets and Maps within the Java. The hardest one was the map assignment which I went
to the tutor for assistance with. She helped me better understand maps and why my method was acting in the way it was. She also helped me
brainstorm possible solutions but I feel like I mostly came to conclusion on my own. Overall pretty good assignment.
