# Chapter 01: Introduction | Completed by Chance Haley

In my repository you will find 4 class and java files for the following assignments from the book "Building Java Programs" 5e:
- 1.2  Spikey
- 1.3  WellFormed
- 1.5  MuchBetter
- 1.13 StarFigures

I did not complete the optional extra credit assignment.

All code was sourced from myself or the book.

The assignment "Spikey" failed the java program test but is virtually identical to the expected program output.
Not sure why it isn't working as I attempted to debug the white space but didn't work... Alas.
