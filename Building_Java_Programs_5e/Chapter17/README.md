# Chapter 17: Binary Trees

Complete the following exercises from the book:
- 17.7 isFull
- 17.9 equals (modified to work with JUnit)
- 17.12 removeLeaves
- 17.15 trim

This assignment demonstrates my ability to create workable methods using a Binary Search Tree. I think my methods are all very efficent, as due to the nature of BSTs and
understanding their strengths. This assignment also demonstrates my ability to create a working test using JUnit and my ability to create JavaDoc documentation to support
my methods. Overall pretty cool assignment and I hope to implement this into my final project.
