# Chapter 18: Hashing and Heaps

I have complete the following exercises from my textbook:


- 18.3 equals (modified to work with JUnit)
- 18.5 retainAll
- 18.10 isConsecutive
- 18.12 stutter

This repository contains the above mentioned four assignments. It demonstrates my proficiency is using Priority Queues and how to properly work with HashSets and
the general concepts of Hashing. I think I struggled the most with understanding and trying to work with HashSets. I think it can be very different working with the concept
of buckets and BigArray such that any null element is completely empty but a non-null element will contain a LinkedList. The difference in how to retrieve the information
is very different than a normal array or LinkedList and requires using both to make my methods work. Overall pretty hard assignment but very gratifying.
I am having some difficulty getting my testStutter() method to work. I think there is some kind of error with the equals method that JUnit is trying to use in it's assertions
that is causing seemingly two equals Priority Queues to return not equal. I still have troubleshooted using other methods so I know that this is not an error on my side.
