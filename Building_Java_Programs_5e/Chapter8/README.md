# Chapter 08: Objects

I have completed the following programming exercises from my textbook.

- Create the TimeSpan class
- 8.7 add
- 8.8 subtract
- 8.9 scale

I did not use any 3rd party material or assistance in making these programs.
I am completing this assignment super late and was not able to figure out how to test my methods, I am quite confident that the logic is 
sound as I did it on ped and pad and found the most straightforward way of allowing the user to change the object using the method calls 
and also keep the parameters of the object ie minutes<60, and both hr && minutes>0.
