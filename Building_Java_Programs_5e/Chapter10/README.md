# Chapter 10: ArrayLists and Comparators

I have completed the following programming exercises from the textbook. 

- 10.4  doubleList
- 10.6  minToFront
- 10.11 stutter
- 10.15 filterRange

The follow methods all manipulate lists and demonstrate my knowledge of the use of ArrayLists. They all failed the tester and the stated reasons
were not clear enough for me to trouble shoot.
