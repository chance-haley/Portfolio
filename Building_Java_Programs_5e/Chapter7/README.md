# Chapter 07: Arrays

I have completed the following programming exercises from the textbook:

- 7.5 mode
- 7.8 median
- 7.16 append
- 7.20 matrixAdd - accidentally did more work, talked with you in person about this.

My tests all failed, not sure why for the mode or median. Append failed due to not having the proper exception however,
the way I wrote the program I do not see how a null pointer error can occur and therefore cannot provide that exception.
Not sure why my matrixAdd program failed the test.


All assignments were completed fairly easily without any outside assistance.
