# Chapter 04: Conditional Execution

I have completed the following programming exercises from the textbook:

- 4.6  printRange
- 4.11 longestName
- 4.18 wordCount (do **NOT** use StringTokenizer, Scanner, Arrays, or Regular Expressions to solve this problem)
- 4.19 quadrant

I did not complete Extra Credit: Project 4.8 caesar.

The first programs print the range between 2 integers. 
The second will give the longest name of a set. 
The third will count the words in a string.
The fourth will give you the quadrant when given coordinates of a 2d plane.
