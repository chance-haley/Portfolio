# Chapter 15: Implementing a Collection Class

Implemented my own ArrayStack<E> that includes the following methods:

- peek
- push
- pop
- realloc
- toString
- equals(Object)
- addAll

This repository demonstrates my ability to create a Collection Class in Java. It also demonstrates my working knowledge of JUnit testing and creating applicable testing
criteria. I have thoroughly tested my Class through it's own Main class and also in a seperate CH15Test using JUnit.
